# üöÄ Ares
**Zero-setup<sup>*</sup> P2P file transfer between Macs and iOS devices**

Ares is a service that I built in under 24 hours, winning first place at [HackED 2016](http://eceweek.compeclub.com/hackathon/) during the University of Alberta's ECE Week.

<sup>* Zero-setup refers to the lack of setup when sending or receiving a file (e.g. opening the AirDrop tab in a Finder window, opening an email client, browsing for files in Dropbox for iOS, etc.), *not* the initial process of installing and setting up the Ares apps</sup>

### Motivation

The existing options for trasferring a file from a Mac to an iOS device (or vice versa) are clumsy or simply unreliable. I Commonly used methods like emailing a file to yourself or using Dropbox are inconvenient because the data has to be uploaded to an intermediary before it can be received by the target device. Apple's own AirDrop is often very unreliable, and the UX is less than ideal. Why do I have to open AirDrop in a Finder tab and *wait* for the devices to discover each other, which sometimes doesn't happen, in order to start a file transfer?

Ares is a technology demo that shows how much more streamlined the entire process could be.
